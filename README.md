• Develop a small unit of measurement converter WPF application.
• Assume the application is a prototype meant to demonstrate feasibility and that a lot of features might be added later.
• All architecture and code decisions are up to you but let us know the reasoning. Just present your skills and what you find is necessary when developing an application.

This task should take between an hour to a couple of hours. There is no time pressure. 
While we are aware that in such a short time boxed setting not everything can be perfect, 
we will especially pay attention to the User Interface, your autonomy and capability to split and complete chunks of work.
In other words, you can't do everything in the timebox so you will have to make decisions on what you do and what you don't (or what you stub).
The deliverable should be a zip or link to some GitHub repository will the source code,
the architecture/decision document (or a readme) and a section where you will provide an imaginary todo list of what could be added or changed in the future.
Kind regards,
Amaury Levé
